"""
Example script to create an empty IP List, create an IPList with contents provided as
a python list, download an IP List in a specified format (txt, json or zip),
and upload an IP List.

IP Lists are a new network element supported in SMC API and engines at version 6.1 or newer.
These allow for individual IP addresses or network addresses, one per line, and can be used
in the source/destination fields of an engine policy.

IPList operations are done by downloading the existing IPList (after creation), modifying
the list contents and uploading back to SMC.

.. note:: Contents of the uploaded IPList will replace the existing contents of the IPList
          with the same name on the SMC.

For upload, a content-type of
multipart/form-data is required with the exception of modifying an IPList as json. The
header type setting is handled by smc-python automatically.

File format for the IPList is::

    1.1.1.0/24
    2.2.2.2
    3.3.3.3
    4.4.4.4
    5.5.5.5
    6.6.6.1-6.6.6.254
    aaaa:bbbb::cccc
    aaaa:bbbb::/32
    aaaa:bbbb::
    ...

Requirements:
* smc-python >= 0.5.0
* Forcepoint NGFW Management Center >= 6.2
